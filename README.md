# d3 map of meteorite strikes

This is a world map of meteorite strikes made with d3.  You can preview it [here](https://alexanderellis.github.io/d3-map/).

One thing that was difficult was determining the proper spacing for restricting map movement to the size of the map.  I recommend the comments [here](https://github.com/AlexanderEllis/d3-map/blob/master/map.js#L117).
